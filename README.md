# Real-Time-Selective-Weed-Detection-System
This repository contains the implementation of a computer vision-based real-time selective weed detection system. Using open-access agricultural video datasets, the system classifies vegetation into Crop and Weed, simulates a spot-spraying robot, and generates spray decision logs â€” all in software with no hardware requirements.
